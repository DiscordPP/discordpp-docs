# Add a Plugin

[priority]: 1

_For a list of plugins check out #ðŸ“ƒplugin-list on the Discord++ Discord server_

## Add It to Your Project

1. Download the Source
   - `git submodule add <repository> [<path>]` is a nice way to have `git` still track the remote repositiories
     - After adding the submodules you want, use `git submodule update --init --recursive` to initialize them.
   - You could also download the plugin as
2. Place them all in a subdirectory of your project. (I use `lib/`)

## Add It to CMake

1. Add `ADD_SUBDIRECTORY(<relative path>)` for Discord++ and each module, e.g.

```cmake
add_subdirectory(lib/plugin-name)
```

2. Add the plugin's equivalent of `discordpp-plugin-name` and each module to your `TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES` command, e.g.

```cmake
TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES(${PROJECT_NAME} ... discordpp-plugin-name)
```

## Add It to Your Code

1. Include the header file for the plugin, e.g.

```cpp
#include <discordpp/plugin-name.hh>
```

2. Add it to your bot object, e.g.

```cpp
using DppBot = discordpp::PluginName<...discordpp::Bot...>;
```

If you're working from [Echo](https://github.com/DiscordPP/echo-bot) or [Build-A-Bot](https://github.com/DiscordPP/build-a-bot) as a template you'll need to do this twice in `include.hh` and once in `extern.cc`
