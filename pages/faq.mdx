# Frequently Asked Questions

[priority]: 4

## Where should I start?
Echo has detailed setup instructions uses all of Discord++'s basic functions

https://github.com/DiscordPP/echo-bot


## How do I use the Linux setup instructions if I'm on Windows?
You could dual-boot or get Discord++ to work with a Windows compiler, but I'd recommend using WSL

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10


## What Linux Distribution should I use?
For beginners, I'd recommend Ubuntu. You could (1) install it under WSL or (2) install it to your system

(2) https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop


## Is this a Discord app for iOS?
No. The video you came from was baseless speculation about a BetterDiscord app for iOS being called Discord++.


## How can I compile Boost myself if my distro has an old version?
It will vary from distro to distro, but try compiling Boost like so: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1180792

It may just work


## Can you teach me C++?
While Discord++ can make for a great beginner's C++ project, it isn't a great thing to learn C++ with. I'd highly recommend Codecademy for that, their C++ course is free:  https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus


## How do I use Nlohmann's JSON library?
Check out the library's README, it's pretty darn good: https://github.com/nlohmann/json


## How do I clone with submodules?
Add `--recursive` to `git clone` for `git clone --recursive <repository>` or you can clone using a graphical tool like GitKraken: https://www.gitkraken.com/invite/mS1RATY9


## How can I download the submodules if I have already cloned the repo non-recursively?
`git submodule update --init --recursive`


## My bot takes a long time to compile.
### Why?
Discord++ is a heard-only library. For some general info, you can read about them in [the answers to this question on StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12671383/benefits-of-header-only-libraries).
The short answer here, though, is that Discord++ is header-only to simplify cross-platform compatibility and to enable the templates for its plugin system
### How can I make it faster?
Your compiler choice can make a huge difference.
I (Aido) currently use Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS in WSL2 on Windows 11 and when I swap from `gcc` to `clang` compilations take 1/4 as long, but your results may vary.

[Echo](https://github.com/DiscordPP/echo-bot) also has a system for partial builds, [which you can see implemented in its `CMakeLists.txt`](https://github.com/DiscordPP/echo-bot/blob/4bb988915007343980c21d4c3be2d13b75e17095/CMakeLists.txt#L20-L22).
By way of precompiling its headers and moving the bot definition to a second object, a clean debug build that takes 6 minutes on `gcc` and 1.5 minutes on `clang` is shortened to 1 minute on both when only the `main.cc` file is changed.
You can also do your initial build outside your IDE to reduce that initial compilation time.
