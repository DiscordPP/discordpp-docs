# Frequently Asked Questions

[priority]: 4

## Where should I start?
Echo has detailed setup instructions uses all of Discord++'s basic functions

## How do I use the Linux setup instructions if I'm on Windows?
You could dual-boot or get Discord++ to work with a Windows compiler, but I'd recommend using WSL

https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10

## What Linux Distribution should I use?
For beginners, I'd recommend Ubuntu. You could (1) install it under WSL or (2) install it to your system

(2) https://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop

## Is this a Discord app for iOS?
No. The video you came from was baseless speculation about a BetterDiscord app for iOS being called Discord++.

## How can I compile Boost myself if my distro has an old version?
It will vary from distro to distro, but try compiling Boost like so: https://ubuntuforums.org/showthread.php?t=1180792

It may just work

## Can you teach me C++?
While Discord++ can make for a great beginner's C++ project, it isn't a great thing to learn C++ with. I'd highly recommend Codecademy for that, their C++ course is free:  https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus

## How do I use Nlohmann's JSON library?
Check out the library's README, it's pretty darn good: https://github.com/nlohmann/json

## How do I clone with submodules?
Add `--recursive` to `git clone` for `git clone --recursive <repository>` or you can clone using a graphical tool like GitKraken: https://www.gitkraken.com/invite/mS1RATY9

## How can I download the submodules if I have already cloned the repo non-recursively?
`git submodule update --init --recursive`
